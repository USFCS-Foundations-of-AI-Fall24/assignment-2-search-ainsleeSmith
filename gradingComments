Assignment 2 comments:

Question 1: Algorithms. 9/10 - better to express A* in terms of b & d.

Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 5/5

DLS: 7/10 - you're using a single variable to track depth, which is not going
to work. The easiest solution is to have each node keep a depth variable; when
you call successors, the child's depth is parent + 1.

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10

Question 3:

read_mars_graph: 5/5

A*: 15/15

count states: 5/5

Question 4: 10/10

Question 5: 10/10 - you're right that the advances in parallelization were
useful for lots of scientific computing problems, such as weather simulation.
